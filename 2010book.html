<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>Policy shifts over the past 20 years have created an agenda for
sustained commitment to integrated employment for individuals with
disabilities. But despite these clear intentions, unemployment of individuals
with disabilities continues to be a major public policy issue. Labor force
statistics for December 2010 indicate that 28 percent of working-age adults
with disabilities are employed, compared with 70 percent of people without
disabilities (Bureau of Labor Statistics, January 2011). Labor force data also indicate
that workers with disabilities have experienced significantly higher levels of
job loss and hardship during the recession of the late 2000s (Kaye, 1010; Fogg,
Harrington, & McMahon, 2010). For people with intellectual and
developmental disabilities (IDD), the disparity in labor market participation
grows. In FY2003, only 26 percent of individuals with IDD supported by
community rehabilitation providers (CRPs) worked in integrated jobs, including
both individual jobs and group supported employment (Metzel, Boeltzig,
Butterworth, Sulewski, & Gilmore, 2007). At the same time, participation in
sheltered or facility-based employment and non-work services has grown
steadily, suggesting that employment services continue to be viewed as an
add-on service rather than a systemic change (Butterworth, Smith, Hall,
Migliore, & Winsor, 2009; Mank, 2003). </p>

<p>States vary widely in their commitment to integrated employment. In
recent years, state IDD agencies have launched employment working groups,
employment initiatives, and employment-first policies and agendas. Effort is
being reflected in some state-level outcome data; however nationally, only an
estimated 20.3 percent of individuals receiving day supports from state IDD
agencies participated in integrated employment services during FY2009. This
number has slowly declined after reaching a peak of 25 percent of individuals
in integrated employment in FY2001.</p>

<p>For the past 20 years, the ICI's Access to
Integrated Employment Project<sup>[<a href="#_ftnref1">1</a>]</sup>, the national data-collection project on day and
employment outcomes, has described the nature of day and employment services
for individuals with IDD and contributed to a comprehensive understanding of
the factors that influence employment outcomes at an individual, service
provider, and state policy level. This report provides statistics over a
20-year period from several existing national datasets that address the status
of employment and economic self-sufficiency for individuals with IDD. The
report contains three major sections:</p>

<ul>
<li>A comprehensive overview that
describes national trends in employment for people with IDD</li>

<li>A topical chapter that provides
an in-depth, qualitative perspective on the factors that affect the employment
trajectory for individuals with IDD </li>

<li>An appendix with individual
state profiles and a national profile</li>
</ul>

<p>Data from several sources is included: ICI's IDD Agency National
Survey of Day and Employment Services from FY1988, 1990, 1993, 1996, 1999,
2001, 2004, 2007, 2008, and 2009, and datasets from the Social Security
Administration (SSA), state Vocational Rehabilitation programs, and the U.S.
Census Bureau (the American Community Survey).</p>

<p>From varying perspectives, each dataset sheds light on the continued
economic disparities that people with intellectual and developmental
disabilities have experienced over the past decade and beyond. More individuals
continue to be supported in facility-based employment, typically earning sub-minimum
wage, than in integrated employment. In the Vocational Rehabilitation (VR)
system, earnings of adults with disabilities are substantially lower compared
to those in the general population. Overall, the findings from the 2010
analysis of employment data suggest that a grim employment situation for
individuals with disabilities continues. The findings also emphasize the call
for a renewed and shared focus across several systems:</p>

<ul>

<li>The observable growth in supported employment that occurred between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s has not
continued. While national estimates suggest modest growth in the number of
individuals in integrated employment services, the percentage of individuals
receiving integrated employment services decreased to 20.3 percent in FY2009.
Moreover, after several years of decline, between FY2008 and 2009 the
percentage of people served in facility-based work and facility-based non-work
increased. Growth in the percentage of individuals in community-based non-work
services has continued for states that report individuals participating in this
service. Facility-based and non-work settings continue to make up the largest
percentage of expenditures for day and employment services. Overall, the
percentage of individuals reported in integrated employment services has
gradually declined since 2001, and commitment across states toward the
expansion of community employment is uneven. While individual states show
promise, national trends continue to challenge the vision of greater employment
opportunity.</li>

<li>Data from the Rehabilitation
Services Administration (FY2002-2009) suggests several trends. In 2009, for
people with IDD within the VR system, the number of overall closures (67,837)
and closures into employment (23,307) declined to the lowest figures of the
period investigated. Most closures for individuals with IDD were people with an
intellectual disability, but the percentage of this group who are people with
autism is growing. Of all the closures in 2009, an increasing percentage
involved transition-age individuals, young adults between 16 and 26 years old
at application, underscoring the importance of supporting a pathway to
employment and a career at a critical life stage. Data also showed that the
time span from application to closure into integrated employment increased
between FY2002-2009. Also during the period studied, weekly earnings and
average hours worked in integrated employment at closure decreased slightly,
whereas hourly earnings increased slightly. </li>

<li>Data from the American Community
Survey illustrate that people with disabilities are significantly less likely
to work compared to their counterparts without disabilities. Further, while the
employment rate declined for many populations during the recent recession, the
decline has been more severe for subgroups of people with disabilities than it
has been for people without disabilities. Among working-age Americans, people
with any disability and people with a cognitive disability were more likely to
live in households below the poverty line.</li>

<li>Despite federal efforts to
increase the use of work incentives-such as PASS, IRWE, and BWE
programs-SSA data consistently show low enrollment in the work incentive
programs across states. SSI recipients with intellectual disabilities work more
but participate in work incentive programs less frequently than their
counterparts with other types of disabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Multiple datasets offer varying insights on the employment situations
of individuals with disabilities, and specifically intellectual and
developmental disabilities. While the data show limited progress in some
systems (e.g., a slight increase in hourly earnings for individuals who exit
the VR system), there remains an urgent need for a re-investment of attention,
priorities, and resources towards economic and employment opportunities for
individuals with IDD. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Enabling people with disabilities to enter the labor market is a
priority concern for federal and state policy makers (Silverstein, Julnes,
& Nolan, 2005). Policy shifts over the last two decades have established an
increasing emphasis on integrated employment, and the federal government has
set the tone for broad-based systems change (Rogan, Novak, Mank, & Martin,
2002). </p>

<p>Even with this clear policy intent, there remains
a significant gap in employment rates between people with and without
disabilities. Labor force statistics for December 2010 estimate that 28 percent
of working-age adults with disabilities are employed, compared with 70 percent
of those without disabilities (Bureau of Labor Statistics, January 2011). Labor
force data also indicate that workers with disabilities have experienced
significantly higher levels of job loss and hardship during the recent
recession (Kaye, 2010; Fogg, Harrington, & McMahon, 2010). For people with
intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), the disparity in employment
participation widens further. In FY2003, only 26 percent of individuals
supported by community rehabilitation providers (CRPs) worked in integrated
jobs (Metzel, Boeltzig, Butterworth, Sulewski, & Gilmore, 2007), and data
suggest that those who are employed work limited hours with low wages (Mank,
2003; Boeltzig, Timmons, & Butterworth, 2008). At the same time,
participation in sheltered employment and non-work services has grown steadily,
suggesting that employment services continue to be viewed as an add-on service
rather than a systemic change (Smith, Butterworth, Hall, Migliore, &
Winsor, 2009; Mank, 2003).</p>

<p>Although nationwide resources and priorities
have not realigned to expand employment, there is substantial evidence that
individual states and community rehabilitation providers are expanding
community employment and focusing on outcomes. In FY2009, Connecticut,
Louisiana, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, and Washington all reported that more than
40 percent of individuals receiving day and employment services were receiving
integrated employment services. Analysis of the FY2004-2005 National
Survey of Community Rehabilitation Providers showed that the majority (81 percent)
of those entering some type of integrated employment worked in individual jobs.
Of those people, most were paid above federal and state minimum wage levels by
their employers and received paid time off (Boeltzig, Timmons, &
Butterworth, 2008).</p>

<p>Recently, as an outgrowth of the ICI's Access to Integrated Employment
project, state IDD agencies have come together as members of the State
Employment Leadership Network, a membership roundtable co-managed with the
National Association of State Directors of Developmental Disabilities Services
dedicated to expanding employment opportunities for individuals with IDD. A
growing number of advocates and states are using "employment first" as a
guiding principle in policy and systems change. </p>

<p>APSE (formerly the Association for Persons in Supported Employment)
reported that 12 states are actively involved in "employment first" initiatives
or considering the launch of similar local efforts within their state (Niemiec,
Lavin, & Owens, 2009). The Alliance for Full Participation, a coalition of
disability advocacy organizations, established employment as the priority for a
2011 national summit and has begun implementing outreach and planning for that
event. In 2008, the Office of Disability and Employment Policy (ODEP) brought
together key leaders in the field to discuss "employment first" policies in
states where sheltered employment with sub-minimum wages and non-work day
activities are no longer acceptable employment outcomes (Romano, 2009).
Expanding these activities was cited as a critical element in supporting people
with disabilities to become important contributors to renewed economic growth.</p>

<h3>Policy and Practice Challenges</h3>

<p>Despite advances in federal policy and the leadership of some
high-performing states, widespread expansion of integrated employment has not
occurred on a national level. Several factors present continuing challenges:</p>

<p><em>State and federal policy do not consistently prioritize employment.</em> Despite spending millions of dollars on secondary
education, adult community services, Social Security disability benefits,
transportation, and comprehensive healthcare for Americans with disabilities,
few of these resources actually encourage or reward integrated community-based
employment (Niemiec, Lavin, & Owens, 2009). State systems continue to
invest in sheltered employment and non-work services. While the number of
individuals with IDD in integrated employment is growing, the number
participating in sheltered employment and non-work services has grown even more
rapidly over the past decade, and CRPs that have closed a facility-based
program report that state agencies are rarely a catalyst for change
(Butterworth, Fesko, & Ma, 2000). Expansion of community-based non-work
services has competed with integrated employment, despite evidence that these
services are poorly defined and do not consistently achieve their stated goals
of community membership (Sulewski, Butterworth, & Gilmore, 2008; Sulewski,
in press).</p>

<p>Using data from the ICI's IDD Agency National
Survey of Day and Employment Services, it was estimated that the total number
of people served by state IDD agencies increased 95 percent (from 287,860 to
560,979) between 1988 and 2009. Over this same period of time, the number of
people receiving integrated employment services increased 241 percent (from
33,386 to 114,004). However, much of this growth occurred between 1988 and
1999. Focusing on more recent data from 1999 to 2009, growth in integrated
employment has not kept pace with the overall growth in the total number of
individuals receiving services. Between 1999 and 2009, the estimated total
number of individuals receiving services increased 22 percent while the number
of individuals receiving integrated employment services only increased by 4.7
percent. Concurrently the percentage of individuals receiving integrated
employment services declined from 23.7 percent to 20.3 percent.</p>

<p>CRPs have not reallocated resources to community
employment. In a national survey of CRPs that provide sub-minimum wage
employment, 89 percent of respondents indicated that sheltered employment was a
necessary service, 69 percent responded that individuals with IDD were unable
to earn minimum wage, and only 47 percent indicated that their organization had
a formal plan to expand integrated employment (Wehman, Inge, Revell,
Butterworth, & Gilmore, 2007).</p>

<p><em>Funding mechanisms vary across states and do not always
reflect policy priorities.</em> Funding
is a central tool for improving the quality and range of employment service
options. In an environment of increasing fiscal demands and limitations, and
expansion of self-directed services and individualized budgeting, there is a
growing need for state IDD systems to engage in rate-setting and funding
discussions that are rooted in their priorities and long-term goals. An
analysis of five states' employment funding structures suggests that there is
no "best" approach in terms of funding methodologies, but there are several
elements that are key (Hall, Freeze, Butterworth, & Hoff, in press). Rate
structure should be selected with a clear underlying intent regarding the goals
of the system. Along those same lines, unambiguous definitions and service
categories should also reflect these priorities. States with policy and funding
alignment pay more for desired outcomes (a job in the community) and less or
not at all for outcomes that are not a priority. Tying rates and other funding
decisions, such as who gets funding, to the ultimate goals of the system sends
an unequivocal message about the expectations of the funder. This includes
clarity about which supports are and are not covered by a rate. States need to
clearly define their expected outcomes, and then develop rates and
methodologies that adequately compensate providers for achieving these goals.
Keeping funding strategies goal-focused includes not only developing incentives
but eliminating disincentives to achieving policy aims. Hall and colleagues (in
press) advocate for effective funding systems to be goal-focused and consistent
with larger systems strategies.</p>

<p><em>Best practices in job support and job development are not
consistently implemented.</em>
Emerging practices such as job creation, customized employment, and
facilitation of natural supports are rarely used in practice at the
direct-support level, reflecting a need to address direct-support professional
training, qualifications, and job roles. For example, in the 2002-2003
ICI Survey of CRPs, only 35 out of more than 38,000 individuals with IDD were
identified as being supported in self-employment. Findings of Migliore and
colleagues (in press) also suggest that direct-support professionals do not
consistently implement evidence-based practices such as person-centered career
planning, use of personal networks, and job negotiation. </p>

<p><em>Individual employment outcomes have not progressed.</em> Findings from the ICI's FY2004-2005
Individual Employment Outcomes Survey show that the majority of individuals
with IDD work part-time and predominantly in the entry-level service industry,
annual income remains low, and individuals have limited access to employee
benefits such as health insurance (Boeltzig, Timmons, & Butterworth, 2008).
A longitudinal comparison of the quality of supported employment outcomes shows
similar results: despite slight improvements in some areas such as worksite
integration, work rate, and work quality, individuals obtaining jobs in the
late 1990s worked similar hours, earned similar wages, and held similar types
of jobs compared to those obtaining jobs in the early 1990s (Mank, Cioffi,
& Yovanoff, 2003). Additionally, Schur, Kruse, Blasi, and Blank (2009)
found that employees with disabilities have less job security, experience
higher levels of supervision and lower rates of participation in
decision-making, and receive lower levels of company-sponsored formal training
and informal training from coworkers.</p>

<h3>Services and Supports Used by People with Intellectual and
Developmental Disabilities</h3>

<p>Employment supports are provided within a context of state and federal
disability policy, workforce development policy, income maintenance and
health-care policy, and a wide array of work-related supports including
transportation, housing, welfare, and childcare. Core supports are funded by
state IDD and Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) agencies, and delivered by a
network of over 12,000 CRPs. State trends and individual decisions about
supports and employment are influenced by state funding for employment support,
Medicaid and Social Security Administration policy, and CRP priorities.</p>

<p><em>State IDD agencies.</em> State IDD agencies remain the primary source of
long-term funding and service coordination for individuals with IDD, providing
funding and monitoring of a wide range of day and employment services. They
support an estimated half a million adults in employment and day services
nationally. The services they provide include employment supports, traditional
facility-based options including sheltered workshops and non-work day
habilitation programs, and community integration services (also referred to as
community-based non-work services). Given their essential role, examining state
IDD policies and practices is vital for understanding the factors that
influence employment outcomes.</p>

<p><em>State VR agencies.</em> State VR agencies provide services to over one
million people annually, with over 600,000 completing services and having their
cases closed in each fiscal year. Approximately 12.3 percent, or 67,837, of
those case closures can be identified as individuals with IDD (people with a
primary disability of intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, or
autism). </p>

<p><em>One-Stop Career Centers.</em> One-Stop Career Centers, established and supported
under the Workforce Investment Act, provide a largely underutilized resource
for individuals with IDD and other disabilities. In 2009, over 548,402
individuals with disabilities registered as job seekers for Wagner
Peyser-funded One-Stop services. Between 2006 and 2009, the number of
registered job seekers with disabilities increased nearly one-third (33
percent). Only 1,176 individuals with IDD who closed out of state VR services
in 2009 were identified as referrals from One-Stop Centers. </p>

<p><em>Medicaid.</em> Medicaid is both a primary funder for health care for individuals with
IDD and the largest federal source of funding for day and employment services
under the Home and Community Based Services waiver program. Despite expansion
of Medicaid initiatives to support employment, including the Medicaid
Infrastructure Grant program and expansion of state Medicaid buy-in programs,
there is no preference for integrated employment in Medicaid-funded services,
and state Medicaid agencies have limited involvement in employment initiatives.
In a study by Sulewski, Gilmore, and Foley (2006), state Medicaid agencies were
asked about the provision of services to working people with disabilities and
collaboration with disability- and employment-related agencies and services.
Only one-third to one-half of respondents were involved in Workforce Investment
Act implementation at the state level or were implementing a Medicaid buy-in
option for working adults with disabilities. Collaboration with disability- or employment-focused
agencies occurred at similarly moderate rates. </p>

<p><em>Social Security.</em> Social Security Administration (SSA) work
incentives such as the Plan for Achieving Self Support (PASS) and
Impairment-Related Work Expenses (IRWE) are designed to support employment by
allowing individuals to exclude money, resources, and certain expenses from
total earned income calculations. SSA also administers the Ticket to Work
program, designed to provide beneficiaries with the ability to purchase
Vocational Rehabilitation, employment, and other support services from any
participating employment network or state VR agency. Despite SSA's initiatives,
work incentives and the Ticket to Work program remain largely underutilized. In
2009, 1,455 SSI recipients had PASS plans and 3,862 had IRWEs in place. That
same year, only 7.3 percent of individuals ages 18 to 64 on SSI were identified
as working (SSA, 2009). </p>

<p><em>Community rehabilitation providers (CRPs).</em> CRPs and their staff are the primary source of day
and employment supports for people with IDD. Based on the results of recent
efforts to build a comprehensive list of CRPs, the ICI estimates that over
12,000 CRPs nationwide offer vocational services to individuals with
disabilities. The majority (70 percent) of those served by CRPs are individuals
with IDD (Metzel, Boeltzig, Butterworth, Sulewski, & Gilmore, 2007; Inge et
al, 2009). Over two thirds of CRPs provide work and non-work services in both
integrated and facility-based settings (Metzel, Boeltzig, Butterworth, Sulewski,
& Gilmore, 2007). Findings indicate that 74 percent of individuals with IDD
received sheltered employment, day habilitation services, or non-work community
integration services, while only 26 percent were working in integrated
employment. Furthermore, of the 26 percent in integrated employment, eight
percent, or almost one-third, were in group supported employment models,
including enclaves and mobile work crews. In a national survey of CRPs that
provide sub-minimum-wage employment, respondents reported that only 8.7 percent
of staff work with individuals earning minimum wage or higher (Inge et al,
2009). </p>

<h3>Factors that Influence Employment Outcomes</h3>

<p>States vary widely in the extent to which they support integrated
employment. Research suggests a range of factors that influence access to
employment opportunities and areas of focus for state policy and strategy.</p>

<p><em>High-performing state IDD agencies.</em> The ICI's research on "high-performing"
state IDD agencies has identified policies and practices that support improved
employment outcomes. The ICI identifies high-performing states based on the
percentage of those served by the state's IDD agency who participate in
integrated employment and the rate of growth in integrated employment.
Strategies that characterize high-performing states include flexibility in
funding and policies; communication of values through data, rewards, and
funding incentives; and innovation diffusion through relationships and training
(Hall, Butterworth, Winsor, Gilmore, & Metzel, 2007). These strategies are
most successful when they are embedded within the context of a solid values
base, a network of dedicated stakeholders, and clarity about systemic goals. </p>

<p><em>Community-based non-work (CBNW).</em> As an
emerging service model, reported participation in CBNW (activities that do not
involve paid employment and take place in the community) has grown steadily
over the past 15 years. Twenty-seven state IDD agencies reported CBNW services
in FY2009. These states indicated that 42.6 percent of individuals that they
served participated in CBNW in FY2009. Results from a module in the 2001
survey of state IDD agencies indicated that CBNW is loosely defined with
respect to requirements, activities, populations served, and goals (Sulewski,
Butterworth, & Gilmore, 2008). Although CBNW has the potential to enhance
the lives of people with disabilities, these findings raise concerns. Key
questions include how CBNW services can be provided without taking resources or
focus away from expanding integrated employment (Sulewski, Butterworth, &
Gilmore, 2008; Sulewski, in press), and the extent to which CBNW services
support true community inclusion. CRPs, for example, have indicated that they
more often support group and disability-specific community-based non-work activities
compared with other more individualized and integrated activities. It is
unclear to what extent the growth in CBNW merely represents a redefinition of
day habilitation and other non-work service models.</p>

<p><em>Collaboration with VR.</em> While policy under the Medicaid Home and Community
Based Waiver program requires that states refer individuals to VR for
employment support prior to providing IDD agency supports under waiver funding,
collaboration is impeded by a wide range of systemic barriers, including
disagreement about target populations, differing commitment to the goal of
employment, differences in language and culture, and differences in resource
availability (Timmons, Cohen, & Fesko, 2004; Timmons, Fesko, & Cohen,
2004). Despite such barriers, collaborative initiatives between VR and IDD
agencies are an important element in supporting stronger employment outcomes
(Boeltzig, Timmons, & Marrone, 2008; Hall, Boeltzig, Hamner, Timmons, &
Fesko, 2006). </p>

<p><em>CRPs and integrated employment.</em> Considerable variation exists in the quality of CRP
service provision (Surdick, Pierson, Menz, Hagen-Foley, & Ussif, n.d.).
Some providers have successfully shifted emphasis to integrated employment
support, including closing one or more facility-based programs (Brooks-Lane, Hutcheson,
& Revell, 2005; Butterworth, Fesko, & Ma, 2000). Butterworth, Gilmore,
Timmons, Inge, and Revell (2007) found that smaller organizations (those
serving one to 40 individuals) had significantly higher rates of participation
in individual and integrated employment. In addition, organizations that served
all or mostly individuals with IDD had significantly lower participation in
individual employment and significantly higher participation in sub-minimum
wage employment. The survey results also suggest that organizational priorities
and goals are critical influences in outcomes and may play a more central role
than commonly accepted factors such as fear of benefits loss, family concerns,
or transportation availability.</p>

<p><em>CRPs and direct-support personnel.</em> Although researchers have
investigated the competencies and training needs of direct-support
professionals (DSPs) in residential settings (Larson & Hewitt, 2005;
Larson, Doljanac, Nord, Salmi, & Hewitt, 2007), very little has been done
to examine the same issues regarding DSPs who assist job seekers with
disabilities. DSPs in integrated employment face complex responsibilities,
ranging from dealing with the dynamics of a business world driven by profit to
addressing the personal needs of people with disabilities (Fesko &
Temelini, 1997; Test, Flowers, & Hewitt, 2004; Wehman &Targett, 2001).
Survey research suggests that employment specialists do not consistently use
established promising practices including spending time with individuals in
community settings, working with an individual's network of family and
acquaintances, or negotiating job responsibilities with an employer (Migliore,
Hall, Butterworth, & Winsor, in press). Expanding knowledge about the roles
and competencies of DSPs in employment is an area in need of further research. </p>

<p><em>Individual and family factors.</em> Research has demonstrated
that wages and hours worked increase dramatically as individuals move from
facility-based to integrated employment, and suggests that less tangible
benefits include expanded social relationships, heightened self-determination,
and more typical job acquisition and job roles (Hall & Kramer, 2009; Mank,
2003; Murphy, Rogan, Handley, Kincaid, & Royce-Davis, 2002). Despite these
advantages, individuals continue to enter facility-based and non-work services
at a higher rate than integrated employment. Researchers investigated what
factors influence adults with IDD and their families to choose a facility-based
setting over community-based employment (Migliore, Grossi, Mank, & Rogan,
2008; Migliore, Mank, Grossi, & Rogan, 2007), and found that the majority
of respondents would at least consider community employment. Long-term
placement, safety, and social environment emerged as the most important
concerns when choosing an employment setting. Other research has found that a
collection of people and factors are considered influential in
employment-related decision-making. These include the family in the formative
years, school-based staff and early employment experiences, the culture of the
CRP, the priorities of the job developer, and personal preferences. Through an
understanding of these persuasive elements, and the points in the employment
process at which they occur, critical intervention points can be used to
optimize employment choices and outcomes
(Timmons, Hall, Winsor, Wolfe, & Bose, in press).</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>For the past 20 years, the Access to Integrated Employment project,
funded by the Administration on Developmental Disabilities, has described
trends in day and employment services for individuals with intellectual and
developmental disabilities, and has contributed to an understanding of the
factors that influence employment outcomes at an individual, service provider,
and state policy level. This report provides statistics over twenty years from
several existing national datasets that address the status of employment and
economic self-sufficiency for individuals with intellectual and developmental
disabilities.</p>

<p>Readers should note that the authors use abbreviations for both
intellectual disability (ID) and intellectual and developmental disabilities
(IDD) in this report. We do this because data sources used in this report allow
us to look at these two distinct groups at different levels of specificity.</p>

<p>We provide a comprehensive overview that describes national trends in
employment for people with IDD, and the appendix provides individual state
profiles with data from several sources: the ICI's IDD Agency National Survey
of Day and Employment Services from FY1999, 2001, 2004, 2007, 2008, and 2009,
and datasets from the Social Security Administration, Vocational
Rehabilitation, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the American Community Survey.
The appendix provides a state-by-state analysis of trends across each dataset.</p>

<p>The topical chapter included in this report is
intended to shed light on employment data from a different perspective.
Accompanying the national large-scale datasets that are presented in this book,
we offer a qualitative, in-depth look into what factors affect decision-making
about the employment process and the employment trajectory at an individual
level. </p>

<h3>Data Sources</h3>

<h4><em>IDD Agency National Survey of Day and Employment Services</em></h4>

<p>This survey is part of a longitudinal study commissioned by the
Administration on Developmental Disabilities to analyze community-based day and
employment service trends between FY1988 and 2009 for individuals with
intellectual and developmental disabilities and closely related conditions. Between
1988 and 2004, the survey was administered on a semi-annual basis; however,
beginning with 2007, information is collected on an annual basis. The most
recent version of the survey is focused on state IDD agency data for FY2009.</p>

<p>The survey is designed to provide the following
information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trends in the number of people served in integrated employment,
facility-based employment, and facility-based and community-based non-work
programs;</li>

<li>Trends in the number of individuals waiting for services;</li>

<li>Funding sources that are being used to support day and employment
services; and</li>

<li>The allocation of funds across day and employment services.</li>
</ul>

<p>The survey has been developed with input and field-testing support
from state IDD agency administrators. Core survey variables include the number
served (total and by day and employment service categories), waiting lists, and
expenditures by service and total funding by source. All questions focus on
community-based day or employment services monitored by the state IDD agency,
including services funded by another state agency (such as the Medicaid
agency), even if the IDD agency does not provide or directly contract for the
service. These items have not been changed since 1996, when the new category of
community-based non-work service was added. Beginning in FY2001, states were
offered the opportunity to complete the survey using a secure website. Each
state's responses from the previous year are listed for reference and updating
if necessary. </p>

<p>The survey was most recently administered in March, 2010 to IDD
agencies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The agency director
from each state and the staff members who responded to the previous survey were
contacted to ensure consistency in the data reported. Initial contact was made
by email and follow up was completed via email and telephone. For the most
recent survey, states were asked to complete the survey using data from FY2009.
States could also amend their FY2008 data by clicking the "Edit 2008 Values"
link at the bottom of the page. </p>

<p>The survey home page provides general information and instructions for
completing the survey. Additionally, instructions and guidance for responding
to the survey questions are included within each question. The survey requests
data on the total number of individuals served; however, if a state does not
have the capacity to adjust for individuals who enter or exit the system during
a fiscal year and can only provide the number served at the end of the fiscal
year (or at some other specific point in time), there is a location on the
survey to provide this information. </p>

<p>Each step of the survey provides an opportunity for states to enter
explanatory comments on their data. The final step of the survey offers states
the opportunity to make suggestions for how the survey could be revised in the
future. States are also asked to identify the information source used to
provide service category data. There is a definitions page that can be referred
to from any page of the survey. A summary of the service category definitions
can be found in Table 1. </p>

<p>After a state has finalized
its response to the survey, ICI staff review the data and follow up with states
whose data shows an unexpected increase or decrease in the total number served,
number served in a service category, or total funding. </p>

<p><em>Estimation of number served.</em> This report used regression analysis to estimate
the total number of individuals served by state IDD agencies and the number of
individuals served in integrated employment when these figures were not
reported. To increase stability of the estimation for states who did not report
for the last data point-FY2009-data from the literature was added.
The 2006 data was drawn from the most recent literature available (Braddock,
Hemp, & Rizzolo, 2008). This procedure was adopted for ten states. </p>

<h4><em>Rehabilitation Services Administration 911(RSA-911) Database</em></h4>

<p>The RSA-911 is a public access database that captures individual
characteristics, services provided, and employment outcomes at the point of
closure from Vocational Rehabilitation services. Records are at the individual
level, covering over 600,000 case closures per year.</p>

<h4><em>American Community Survey</em></h4>

<p>The American Community Survey (ACS) is a national survey designed by
the U.S. Census Bureau to better understand changing communities. The ACS
collects information from all 50 states and D.C. on topics such as disability,
age, race, income, commute time to work, home value, veteran status, and other
demographic and personal data (<em>source: www.census.gov</em>). To gather information on people with
disabilities, the Census Bureau asks a series of six questions on long-lasting
conditions and functional impairments. Any person who indicates having at least
one of these conditions or functional impairments is coded as having a
disability. The individual items used to collect these data points are outlined
in Table 3.</p>

<p>Due to changes implemented in the American Community Survey in 2008,
data for people with disabilities for 2007 and earlier years should not be
compared with data beginning in 2008. The sensory disability item used from
2000-2007 was eliminated and two distinct items for visual and hearing
disabilities were added beginning in 2008. The employment disability variable
that was used from 2000-2007 was eliminated from the survey beginning in
2008. Additional changes in wording for other disability items included
removing the duration of impairment from some questions and adding the term "serious"
to focus on long-term/more severe impairments.<a href="#_ftn2"

taken from the U.S. Census website (www.census.gov). Unemployment data is taken
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics website (www.bls.gov), and earnings data is
taken from the Bureau of Economic Analysis website (www.bea.gov).</p>

<h2>National Trends in Employment</h2>

<h3>IDD Agency National Survey of Day and Employment Services
(FY1999-2009)</h3>

<p>The data reported here are the core elements of the Institute for
Community Inclusion's IDD Agency National Survey of Day and Employment
Services. These data focus on participation in integrated employment,
community-based non-work, and facility-based services. Data are solicited from
the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The number of reporting states
varied from 37 to 45 over the time studied (1999-2009). The researchers
calculated national-level estimates for the total number of people served by
state IDD agencies as well as the total number of people who received
integrated employment services. For some states, data reported by service
setting represent duplicated counts because individuals were served in multiple
settings. For these states, the percentage served across settings may add to
more than 100 percent. In addition, other services, including services for
individuals who are elderly, are not reported. </p>

<p>Major findings include the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>While national estimates suggest modest growth in the number of
individuals in integrated employment services, the percentage of individuals
receiving integrated employment services declined to 20.3 percent in FY2009.</li>

<li>The growth seen in supported employment between the mid-1980s and
mid-1990s has not continued. </li>

<li>After several years of decline, between FY2008 and 2009, the
percentage of people served in facility-based work and facility-based non-work
increased.</li>

<li>Growth in community-based non-work services has continued for states
that report on this service.</li>

<li>There is large variation across states in participation in integrated
employment.</li>
</ul>

<p>In FY2009, an estimated 560,979 individuals received day or employment
supports from state IDD program agencies. This number grew from 458,650 in
FY1999. The estimated number of individuals supported in integrated employment
services increased from 108,827 in FY1999 to 114,004 in FY2009. State
investment in supports continues to emphasize facility-based and non-work
services rather than integrated employment services.</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows the trends in the percentage of people served in
integrated employment and facility-based work, facility-based non-work, and
community-based non-work settings between FY2004 and FY2009. In FY2009, an
estimated 20.3 percent of individuals receiving day supports from state
IDD agencies received integrated employment services. The data demonstrate a
decline in the estimated percentage of people served in integrated employment
services (from 23.7 percent in 1999), suggesting that the growth seen in
supported employment between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s has not continued. The
data also demonstrate an increase in the percentage of people served in
facility-based and non-work settings. The service setting with the highest
reported percentage of individuals receiving services in FY2009 was
community-based non-work (42.6 percent), followed by facility-based non-work
(36.1 percent) and facility-based work (27.1 percent). Variability in the number
of states that are able to report data in these three individual service
categories limits our ability to pinpoint the specific setting in which growth
is occurring; however analysis using data from states that are able to report
data in each of the three service categories suggests that the percentage of
individuals served in facility-based and non-work settings is increasing.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2. Estimated IDD Agency Service Distribution by Service
Category by Year</strong></p>

<p>* Percents displayed
represent estimates for the number of people served in integrated employment nationally
(in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.).</p>

<p>** Percents
displayed are the reported percentage of people served in that setting for all
states that were able to provide data. Reporting states may vary from year to
year and across services.</p>

<p>Presently, states vary in their ability to report
on funding for day and employment services by service setting. Figure 3 shows
trends in funding allocation by service setting for states that reported these
monetary figures. Facility-based and non-work settings continue to make up the
largest percentage of expenditures for day and employment services.
Collectively, states that reported funding for all facility-based work and
non-work services (n=30) allocated 88 percent of the funding for day and
employment to services in these settings in FY2009. Alternatively, states that
reported funding for integrated employment (n=36) allocated 12 percent of the
funding for day and employment to integrated employment services in FY2009.
While there has been a net decrease in the percentage of reported funds
allocated toward facility-based work and non-work services since 1999, there
has been little fluctuation over time in the percentage of funding allocated
toward integrated employment which peaked in 2001 at 16.6 percent but otherwise
ranged between 9.6 percent and 12.7 percent in all other years since 1999.</p>

States Reporting in Parenthesis)</strong></p>

<p><em>Growth in community-based non-work.</em> Nationally, the reported participation in
community-based non-work (CBNW) services has grown steadily for states that
report it as a service, from 18.7 percent in FY1999 to 42.6 percent in FY2009.
First added to the survey as a service option in FY1996 in response to state feedback,
the number of states reporting individuals in CBNW has grown from 18 in FY1996
to 27 in FY2009. Community-based non-work services accounted for over 56.5
percent of state IDD agency expenditures for FY2009, for states that reported
expenditures for this service (n=20).</p>

<p>The rapid growth in CBNW services may reflect a growing emphasis on
community presence, although the contribution of this service to community
participation remains unclear. There is currently a limited amount of data on
the structure, activities, and outcomes of this service, and states have not
established clear service expectations or quality-assurance strategies
(Sulewski, Butterworth,& Gilmore, 2008; Sulewski, in press). While some
states report service requirements with respect to how much time CBNW
participants spend in the community, it is possible that in some cases states
have reclassified services from facility-based to community-based as the
emphasis on community participation grows, even though substantial time is
still spent in facility-based settings. As the prevalence of CBNW services
grows, additional research is needed on whether these services enhance or
impede integrated employment outcomes and how CBNW services contribute to
meaningful day time activities for individuals with IDD. </p>

<p><em>Funding from state, county, and local sources.</em> State, county, and local IDD dollars are one of the
largest sources of funds for day and employment services; additionally, as a
funding source that is directly controlled within each state, it is one of the
most flexible sources of dollars for day and employment services. Similar to
funding by service category, states vary in
their ability to report state, county, and local spending on IDD services. As
the number of states able to report these figures increases, it will be
interesting to examine both the cross-sectional and trend data for this type of
funding. For states that have been able to report these figures, the allocation
of these funds has varied based upon year and service category: integrated
employment, community-based non-work, facility-based work, and facility-based
non-work.</p>

<p>Total reported state, county, and local IDD dollars have increased
slightly from $1,480,531,831 (n=25) to $1,517,346,940 (n=24) between 1999 and
2009. The percentage of funds allocated to all facility-based services declined
from 65 percent in 1999 to 54.5 percent in 2009, but did not result in a
substantial increase in funds being allocated toward integrated employment;
instead, dollars have shifted toward community-based non-work services.
Reported dollars for community-based non-work increased from $279,490,187
(n=13) to $437,176,247 (n=12) between 1999 and 2009. This change coincided with
a decrease in the funds allocated toward facility-based non-work services from
$470,893,634 (n=16) to $214,854,192 (n=13). One potential explanation for the
significant redistribution of funds toward community-based non-work services is
that traditional facility-based non-work services are being rebranded as
community-based non-work services.</p>

<p>Since 2004, there has been an increase in the percentage of state,
county, and local IDD funds allocated toward all community-based services.
While this is hopeful and could be an indication that states are placing a
greater emphasis on community inclusion, ultimately state, county, and local
IDD dollars are increasingly being spent on CBNW services and not integrated
employment. The trend toward CBNW services raises concerns about the clarity of
the service system's goals for community employment. It is highly likely, due
to the lack of specificity of the goals of CBNW services (Sulewski,
Butterworth,& Gilmore, 2006), that as funds transition to the community,
non-work services are seen as an alternative rather than a complement to or an
avenue towards integrated employment services. Sulewski, Butterworth, and
Gilmore (2008) recommend that states use CBNW services as a supplement to,
rather than a substitute for, integrated employment services. States need to
clarify the intent and goals of CBNW services and their relationship to
integrated employment.</p>

<h3>Trends in Vocational Rehabilitation Outcomes for Individuals with IDD
(2002-2009)</h3>

<p>This section describes trends in outcomes of the VR program for adults
with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) during the period of
FY2002 to 2009. </p>

<p>In summary: </p>
<ul>
<li>The number of closures, and closures into employment, declined.</li>

<li>Most closures for individuals with IDD were people with an
intellectual disability, but the percentage of this group who are people with
autism is growing.</li>

<li>The majority of VR closures were transition-age youth (16-26
years old) at the time of application for VR services.</li>

<li>The majority of VR closures are male and White.</li>

<li>The time span from application to closure into integrated employment
increased.</li>

<li>The rehabilitation rate, weekly wage, and average hours worked varied
substantially across states and over time.</li>

<li>Weekly earnings and average hours worked in integrated employment at
closure decreased slightly, whereas hourly earnings increased slightly.</li>


<li>VR engagement and delivery of services varied
substantially across states in 2009.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>The number of closures, and closures into employment,
declined.</em> In 2009, VR
closed 67,837 cases for people with IDD, the smallest number in the period examined
and a substantial drop from 72,541 in 2008 (Mean=70,901 for all years
examined). Similarly, the number of closures in employment declined
substantially from 27,153 in 2008 to 23,307 in 2009-the lowest level
during the period examined (Mean=27,139; Min=23,307; Max=28,601).</p>

<p>*Based on people who received VR services</p>
<p><em>Most closures among individuals with IDD were people with
an intellectual disability, but the percentage of this group who are people
with autism is growing.</em> In
2009, 81.7 percent of closures of people with IDD were people with intellectual
disabilities. This number, which began declining in 2006, was the lowest figure
during the period investigated (Mean=83.1 percent, Max=84 percent). The
percentage of people with cerebral palsy was 7.1 percent in 2009, a figure that
is similar to other years of the period investigated (Mean=7.2 percent; Min=7.0
percent; Max=7.5 percent), whereas the percentage of people with epilepsy
decreased slightly to 5.7 percent, the lowest percentage for the period
examined (Mean=6.5 percent; Max=7.9 percent). The decline in the percentage of
people with intellectual disabilities and the percentage of people with
epilepsy corresponded to an increase in the percentage of people with autism
from 1.8 percent in 2003 to 5.5 percent in 2009, the highest level observed
during the period examined (Mean=3.1 percent).</p>

<p><em>The majority of VR closures were transition-age youth
(16-26 years old) at the time of application for VR services.</em> Of all the closures in 2009, 63.7 percent were of
people of transition age, between 16 and 26 years old, at application. This was
the highest percentage out of all the years examined and grew from 55.7 percent
in 2002 (Mean=60.4 percent). These figures underscore the need for VR
counselors to understand the needs of transition-age youth with IDD and to
support a pathway to employment and a career at a critical life stage. </p>

<p><em>The majority of VR closures are male and White.</em> The majority of VR customers with IDD were male
(58.8 percent; Mean=56.4 percent; Min=54.9 percent; Max=58.8 percent). Most
closures in 2009 involved Whites (70.2 percent), the highest percentage during
the period examined (Min=65.6 percent; Mean=68.8 percent). People of color made
up 27.3 percent of VR customers with IDD in 2009, a figure that fluctuated
slightly between 26.2 percent and 28.2 percent during the period examined
(Mean=27.4 percent). Nearly all closures were of people of non-Hispanic ethnicity
(92.2 percent). This figure was relatively stable over the period described
(Mean=92.4 percent; Min=91.8 percent; Max=92.8 percent).</p>

<p><em>The time span from application to closure in integrated
employment increased.</em> VR
typically closes successful cases when applicants have been employed for at
least 90 days. In 2009, closures into integrated employment for people who were
not working in integrated employment at application took 735 days on average
from the time of application to closure from the VR system. This figure was the
greatest over the period studied, whereas the smallest figure was 672 days in
2003 (Mean=710). The average number of days from application to closure was
about two months shorter if applicants who received postsecondary services are
excluded (Mean=652; Min=618; Max=666). </p>

<p><em>The rehabilitation rate, weekly wage, and average hours
worked varied substantially across states and over time.</em> Of the people who progressed through the
application process to receive VR services, an average of 56 percent per state
exited with an employment outcome. This figure varied from a low of 26 percent
in Hawaii to a high of 83 percent in Wyoming. The 56 percent rehabilitation
rate for people with IDD in 2009 matches the rate for 2004 and is the lowest
rehabilitation rate for this group out of all years examined. Weekly earnings
at closure also varied substantially from $162 in Maine to $349 in D.C.
(Mean=$225). Finally, average hours worked per week ranged from 17 in Maine to
32 in Georgia and DC (Mean=25). Both weekly earnings and hours worked refer to
people in integrated employment who did not have integrated employment at
application.</p>

<p><em>Weekly earnings and average hours worked in integrated
employment at closure decreased slightly, whereas hourly earnings increased slightly.</em> In 2009 average weekly
earnings at closure were $213, a figure smaller than previous years when, for
instance in 2003, inflation-adjusted weekly earnings peaked at $224 (Mean=$217;
Min=$211; Max=$224). If expressed as hourly earnings, inflation-adjusted wages
increased from the minimum of $7.89 in 2006 to $8.36 in 2009. However, hourly
earnings in 2009 were about the same as in 2002 ($8.27; Mean=$8.10; Min=$7.89;
Max=$8.36). Inflation-adjusted earnings are expressed in 2009 equivalent value<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a>. The average number of hours
worked per week, at closure, declined from 26.4 per week in 2004 to 24.7 per
week in 2009 (Mean=25.8; Min=24.7; Max=26.4). Both earnings and hours worked
refer to people who gained integrated employment and who did not have jobs in
integrated employment at application.</p>

<p>As Figure 4 shows, the gap between earnings of adults with IDD at
closure and personal income in the general population was substantial. </p>

<p><strong>Figure 4. Weekly Earnings of People with IDD and the General
Population</strong></p>

<p><img src="images/sd_imgs/figure4.png" alt="figure 4" />[<a href="http://www.communityinclusion.org/images/sd_imgs/sdbook11_desc.htm#fig4">d</a>]</p>

<p>Data refer to earnings of people with IDD in integrated employment who
did not have integrated employment at application and-for the general
population-to pre-tax wages received as employees as reported in the
American Community Survey<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></a>. All figures are expressed in 2009 dollar values. </p>

<p><em>VR engagement and delivery of services varied substantially
across states.</em> This
section focuses on two broad indicators regarding the VR program's role in
assisting job seekers with IDD: VR engagement and the percentage of applicants
who received services.</p>

<p>We define VR engagement as the number of people
with IDD who exited the VR program per every 100,000 people in the general
population of a state. This indicator gauges the effectiveness of state VR
programs in attracting job seekers with IDD in comparison to other states. A
higher VR engagement of a state VR program indicates that a higher number of
job seekers with IDD sought VR services in that state. In FY2009, VR engagement
varied from a minimum of nine job seekers per 100,000 people in the general
population in Arizona, Nevada, and D.C. to a more than sevenfold figure of 67 in
Vermont (Mean=26).<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><sup><sup>[5]</sup></sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Figure 5. Percentage of People with IDD Receiving VR Services -
FY2009</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/sd_imgs/figure5.png" alt="figure 5" />[<a href="http://www.communityinclusion.org/images/sd_imgs/sdbook11_desc.htm#fig5">d</a>]</p>

<p>However, VR engagement is only one aspect of
understanding VR support to people with IDD. Another important indicator is the
percentage of applicants who in fact receive VR services. This indicator is
important because people who receive services are on a track towards
employment; in contrast, people who do not receive services will exit the
program without employment. As Figure 5 shows, the percentage of people with
IDD who received VR services varied substantially across states, from 37
percent in Missouri to 86 percent in Alabama (Mean=63 percent). Figure 5 also
shows that some of the applicants who did not receive services exited the
program before their eligibility determination was completed. The total number
of closures for each state is reported in parentheses. </p>

<h3>Trends from the American Community Survey (ACS) (2008-2009)</h3>

<p>Data show that people with disabilities are
consistently less likely to be working than their counterparts without
disabilities. The ACS dataset allows for comparison of employment participation
and outcomes for civilian working-age people with and without disabilities.
Population estimates generated from these data include people who do not
receive formal supports from a human-service agency. Thus, it offers a broader
view of employment outcomes for working-age people with disabilities than
system-specific data sources such as the Rehabilitation Services Administration
(RSA) 911 data. We define "working-age" as civilian non-institutionalized
people ages 16-64. The data presented below will emphasize the ACS
disability category of cognitive disability as the closest proxy for
individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. We discuss a
number of employment outcome indicators to give an expansive overview of the
state of employment for people with disabilities and to allow for appropriate
comparisons across disability groups and with people who report no
disabilities.</p>

<p>Recent trends and key data points that emerged from
the dataset: </p>
<ul>
<li>People with disabilities are much less likely to work than their
counterparts without disabilities.</li>

<li>The employment rate has declined for many populations during the
recent recession, but the decline has been more severe for subgroups of people
with disabilities than it has been for people without disabilities.</li>

<li>People with a cognitive disability saw a greater drop in their
employment rate than people with any disability between 2008 and 2009.</li>

<li>People with a cognitive disability who are receiving Supplemental
Security Income (SSI), the group likely to include people who have the most
significant cognitive disabilities, have the lowest employment rate of all
disability subgroups examined. </li>

<li>Among working-age Americans, people with any disability and people
with a cognitive disability are more likely to live in a household that is
below the poverty line.</li>

<li>People with disabilities who are employed are less likely to live
below the poverty line than people with disabilities who are not employed,
supporting arguments that working is a path to economic self-sufficiency for
people with disabilities.</li>

<li>People in disability subgroups receive a greater percentage of their
annual income from non-work sources like SSI and other Social Security
Administration programs compared to people without disabilities.</li>


</ul>
<h4><em>Recent Employment and Labor Market Benchmarks for Population Subgroups</em></h4>
<p><em>People with disabilities are much less likely to work than
people without disabilities.</em>
In assessing employment outcomes, it
is important to review multiple indicators to get a full understanding of the
employment experiences of people with disabilities. Indicators commonly used in
labor market and population studies include:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Employed</em>: People with jobs. </li>

<li><em>Unemployed</em>: People who do not have jobs and have actively looked for work in the
past four weeks. These people are considered part of the labor force.</li>

<li><em>Not in the labor force</em>: People who do not have jobs and have not actively
looked for work in the past four weeks.</li>

<li><em>Employment rate</em> (Employment-to-population ratio): Number of people
employed / number of people in the civilian working-age population</li>

<li><em>Unemployment rate</em>: Number unemployed / (number employed + number
unemployed) </li>
</ul>
<p>Reporting meaningful indicators of labor market success for
individuals with disabilities, particularly IDD, is challenging for a number of
reasons. Measures that allow people to indicate specific disabilities like
intellectual disability are uncommon in
large national datasets. Additionally, the use of the "traditional"
unemployment rate reported by the U.S. Department of Labor as an indicator of
labor market success for people with disabilities does not include people who
are not in the labor force in the calculation, which is a significant group
when it comes to subpopulations of people with disabilities. For this reason,
we focus primarily on the employment rate as an indicator of successful
employment outcomes for people with disabilities. Because a large proportion of
people with disabilities are not in the labor force, an
employment-to-population ratio is a more descriptive measure of this
population's economic situation (Brault, 2010).</p>

<p>While the ACS does not collect information on people with IDD
specifically, it does allow people to self-report on six disability questions.
Any individual who answers yes to one or more of these six items is categorized
as having a disability. Someone with a cognitive disability has indicated that
because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition lasting six months or
more, s/he has difficulty learning, remembering, and concentrating. Table 7
displays indicators of labor market success for four groups of working-age
individuals: People who do not have a disability, people who indicated they
have at least one disability (Any Disability), people with a cognitive
disability, and people with a cognitive disability who received Supplemental
Security Income (SSI) in 2009. This last group is likely to include people who
have the most significant cognitive disabilities.</p>

<em>Source: 2009 American Community Survey</em></p>

<p>The table confirms the low levels of employment for individuals with
disabilities. People with any disability or a cognitive disability are employed
at much lower rates (34.9 percent and 23.9 percent respectively) than those
without disabilities (71.9 percent). People with cognitive disabilities who
receive SSI have the lowest employment rate, with only 9 percent of individuals
in this group employed.</p>

<p>There are striking differences in outcomes between disability
subgroups and their nondisabled counterparts with regard to the percent not in
the labor force (see Table 7). Across disability subgroups, all are much less
likely to be in the labor force than people without disabilities. The high rate
of individuals who are not in the labor force suggests that a significant
majority of individuals with disabilities are not actively looking for work,
despite the fact that many individuals with disabilities who are not working
report that they would prefer to work (Migliore, Mank, Grossi, &Rogan,
2007). People with disabilities who are not in the labor force are more likely
to rely on publicly-funded poverty-prevention programs such as SSI for income,
and may be marginalized from society because of the lack of community
attachment that comes with work. </p>

<p>Individuals with disabilities also fare poorly, comparatively, using
the traditional calculation of unemployment rate favored as a labor market
indicator by the U.S. Department of Labor. Unemployment rates for subgroups of
people with disabilities who are in the labor force are two to three times the
unemployment rate for people without disabilities. These figures may reflect a
longer job search and the difficulty individuals with disabilities face in
reentering the workforce after a job loss.</p>

<p>These data suggest the importance of examining 1) the percent
employed, percent unemployed, and percent not in the labor force (indicators A,
B, and C in Table 7) and 2) the unemployment rate in order to gain a full
understanding of the employment experiences of individuals with disabilities. </p>

<h4>The Effect of the Economic Recession on Employment of People with
Disabilities</h4>

<p><em>People with disabilities were differentially affected by
the economic downturn due to their lower overall rate of employment
participation (Brault, 2010)</em>. An analysis of trends over 21 months of data from the Current
Population Survey (CPS)<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><sup><sup>[6]</sup></sup></a> reveals strong evidence that the recession period
during the late 2000's has disproportionately affected workers with
disabilities, resulting in a nine percent decline in the presence of people
with disabilities in the employed labor force (Kaye, 2010). While the recession
negatively affected employment for many subgroups of people, including those
without disabilities, the effect on employment for people in disability
subgroups was more severe. Evidence suggests that people with disabilities were
the first to be laid off and the increase in job exit has a larger magnitude and
occurs earlier for workers with disabilities than for others (Kaye, 2010).The
disproportionately negative effect of the recession on people with disabilities
is also observed when comparing data from the 2008 and 2009 ACS.</p>

<p>Table 8 shows that the employment rate decreased between 2008 and 2009
for all groups. The rightmost column in this table shows the percentage change
in employment rate within groups between the two years. The decline in
employment for people with any disability was twice that of the decline for
people with no disabilities (-9.4 percent versus -4.4 percent). This decline
was even greater for people with cognitive disabilities (-12.5 percent). People
with a cognitive disability who received SSI as part of their income saw the
biggest decline in employment of all groups profiled: -15.1 percent. While
there is not yet post-recession data to analyze the effect of the economic
recovery on employment for subgroups profiled, some suggest hiring for people
with disabilities may lag behind hiring for their nondisabled counterparts
(Kaye, 2010). Future research should test whether or not subgroups of people
with disabilities experience a longer period between the onset of a recession

<h4><em>Disability, Employment, and Poverty Status</em></h4>

<p><em>Among working-age Americans, people with any disability and
people with a cognitive disability are more likely to be living below the
poverty line than people without a disability.</em> In 2009, only 11.8 percent of all people without a
disability lived below the poverty line, compared with 26.6 percent for people
with any disability, 33.2 percent for people with a cognitive disability, and
42.3 percent for people with a cognitive disability who received SSI payments
as part of their income.</p>

<p>Table 9 compares poverty rates for population subgroups of working-age
people who are employed and who are not employed. Pearson Chi Square tests were
run for each subgroup and the results in each instance showed that people who
are working are less likely to be living in a household below the poverty line
than people who are not working. Results of all Pearson Chi-Square tests were
significant at a= .001. The difference in poverty rates between
people who are employed and people who are not shows how critical work is to
economic self-sufficiency. It is striking that nearly half (44.9 percent) of
the people who had a cognitive disability, received SSI payments as part of
their income, and were not working, were living below the poverty line. The
poverty rate was almost 30 percent lower for people in this same subgroup who
were working.</p>

<p>Although people in disability subgroups who worked were less likely to
be living in poverty than their non-working counterparts, the poverty rates for
disability subpopulations who work are still higher than the poverty rates for
their non-disabled counterparts who work.</p>

<h4><em>Disability and Sources of Income</em></h4>

<p><em>People in disability subgroups have annual incomes that are
much lower than those of people without disabilities. Furthermore, a greater
percentage of annual income for people in disability
subgroups comes from non-work sources such as SSI or other Social Security
programs.</em> Working-age
people without disabilities had a mean annual income, from all income sources,
of $41,750 in 2009. This is much higher than the mean annual income for people
with any disability ($23,364), people with a cognitive disability ($16,544),
and the subgroup of people with a cognitive disability who received SSI
payments ($10,990). There are a number of factors that explain why people with
disabilities have much lower annual incomes than their non-disabled
counterparts. The major explanatory factors are that they work fewer weeks out
of the year and fewer hours per week on average when they are working, and thus
have less opportunity to earn income, and also work in jobs that have lower
wages and may be less stable. People with disabilities are also more reliant on
non-work income sources such as SSI, which does not offer the income potential
of most employment opportunities.</p>

<p>People from disability subgroups, on average, get a greater percentage
of their annual income from non-work sources including SSI, Social Security,
and other sources<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><sup><sup>[7]</sup></sup></a>. Figure 6 displays income source distribution
information from the 2009 ACS for three population subgroups: people with no
disabilities, people with any disability, and people with a cognitive
disability. Looking at the pie chart for people with no disabilities, we see
that for this population, nearly all income (92 percent) in 2009 was earnings
from work, i.e., wage or salary work or earnings from self-employment. Earnings
from SSI and Social Security account for only one percent of all earnings for
this group. For people with any disability, the percent of earnings from work
decreases to 63 percent and the percent of earnings from SSI and Social
Security increases to 19 percent, with other sources accounting for the final
18 percent of their total income. For people with a cognitive disability,
earnings from work account for less than half of all income (47 percent) and
SSI and Social Security account for nearly one-third (32 percent) of all
income.</p>

<p>Because disability status is an eligibility factor for SSI and some
Social Security programs, it is not surprising to see people with reported
disabilities gaining a greater portion of their annual income from these
sources than people without disabilities. It should be noted that the pie
charts in Figure 6 include people who were working and people who were not
working for each group. Income source distributions are likely to vary within
subgroups based on employment status.</p>

<h3>Trends in Social Security Administration Data (1993-2009)</h3>

<p>The Supplemental Security Income program (SSI)
administered by the Social Security Administration provides cash assistance to
low-income individuals who are seniors, blind, or have a disability. Analysis
of this dataset revealed these key findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overall, work-incentive programs for SSI recipients with disabilities
remain largely underutilized.</li>

<li>SSI recipients with ID work more than their counterparts with other
types of disabilities, but participate in work-incentive programs less
frequently. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Work incentives remain largely underutilized.</em> Congress has enacted a number of work-incentive
programs for SSI recipients with disabilities after concluding additional
incentives were necessary to help individuals become self-supporting. Moreover,
Congress has noted that individuals who could work in integrated employment
might have been discouraged from doing so by the fear of losing their benefits
before they had established the capability for continued self-support.</p>

<p>To encourage employment for individuals with disabilities, the Social
Security Administration (SSA) offers special provisions that limit the impact
of earnings from work on eligibility for SSI or Social Security Disability
Insurance (SSDI) benefits. These work incentives include the Plan to Achieve
Self-Support (PASS), Impairment-Related Work Expenses (IRWE), Blind Work
Expenses (BWE), and section 1619(a) and section 1619(b) benefits.</p>

<p>PASS, IRWE, and BWE allow individuals to set aside
money, resources, and expenses to be excluded from total earned income
calculations. PASS allows people to set aside money and resources to be used
for attaining a work goal such as going back to school, finding a better job,
or starting a business. IRWE allows people to exclude current
impairment-related expenses from income that are necessary for work, such as
attendant care, transportation, medications, or specialized equipment. BWE
allows the exclusion of any expenses related to earning income in deciding SSI
eligibility and the SSI payment amount for workers who are blind including
service animal expenses, income taxes, visual/sensory aids, and professional or
union dues. Section 1619(a) allows people with disabilities to continue
receiving SSI income even if their earned income is at Substantial Gainful
Activity (SGA) levels, i.e., the amount that would normally make them
ineligible for SSI. Section 1619(b) allows individuals to continue receiving
Medicaid benefits if their earnings disqualify them from eligibility for SSI
cash payments but are not enough to allow them to afford medical insurance.</p>

<p>A notable trend is the sharp drop in the number of people enrolled in
the PASS program between 1995 and 1997. This decline followed a publication of
the General Accounting Office that criticized SSA for being too lenient in
accepting applicants into a program deemed ineffective for achieving the goal
of self-support. The procedures for acceptance were then reevaluated by SSA and
amended, resulting in fewer approvals in subsequent years. Recent data have
also shown a decrease in the average number of IRWE and BWE enrollees as well.
Enrollments in the IRWE and BWE programs were lower in 2009 than they were in
any other year analyzed.</p>

<em>SSI recipients with ID have a higher employment rate but
participate in work-incentive programs less
frequently than their counterparts with other types of disabilities.</em> Over one-fifth (20.7 percent) of all SSI recipients
with disabilities ages 18-64 in 2009 were individuals with an
intellectual disability (ID). Next to individuals classified as having other
mental disorders, this is the largest disability subgroup among SSI recipients.
SSI recipients with ID have had relative success with employment outcomes
compared to recipients who do not have ID. In 2009 the rate at which SSI
recipients with ID worked was more than twice that of SSI recipients without ID
(14 percent versus 5.5 percent). The rate of employment among SSI recipients
with ID was third among all disability subgroups behind people whose diagnostic
category was unknown (17.6 percent) and people with congenital anomalies (17.3
percent).</p>

<p>SSI recipients with ID participate in the 1619(a) and 1619(b) work
incentive programs at lower rates than SSI recipients with other disabilities
(see Table 11). SSI recipients with ID participate in the IRWE program at
slightly higher rates than recipients with other disabilities. A number of
factors could explain these differences in participation. Analysis of other
data sources, e.g., the Rehabilitation Services Administration 911, has shown
that people with ID often work fewer hours and earn less than individuals from
other disability subgroups. As a result, individuals with ID who work are less
likely to have earnings close to SGA, and may be at lower risk of loss of
benefits because of earnings.</p>

<p>The low rates of participation in incentive programs by SSI recipients
with ID should not overshadow the overall impact of the program. For instance,
in 2009 section 1619(b) benefits allowed more than 24,974 individuals with ID
to continue working and receiving Medicaid benefits. Better explanations of
incentives and greater encouragement of participation in incentive programs by
employment and disability-services professionals could lead to higher rates of
employment and better employment outcomes for individuals receiving SSI.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>From varying perspectives, each dataset sheds light on the continued
economic disparities that people with intellectual and developmental
disabilities have experienced over the past decade. More individuals continue
to be supported in facility-based employment, typically earning sub-minimum
wage, than in integrated employment. In the VR system, earnings of adults with
disabilities are substantially lower compared to those in the general
population. Overall, the findings from the 2010 analysis of employment data
suggest that a grim employment situation for individuals with disabilities
continues. Conclusions drawn from this data emphasize the call for a renewed
and shared focus across several systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Observable growth in supported employment that occurred between the
mid-1980s and mid-1990s has not continued. While national estimates suggest
modest growth in the number of individuals in integrated employment services,
the percentage of individuals receiving integrated employment services
decreased to 20.3 percent in FY2009. Moreover, after several years of decline,
between FY2008 and 2009, the percentage of people served in facility-based work
and facility-based non-work increased. Growth in community-based non-work
services has continued for states that report on this service. Facility-based
and non-work settings continue to make up the largest percentage of
expenditures for day and employment services. Overall, the percentage of
individuals reported in integrated employment services has gradually declined
since 2001, and commitment across states toward the expansion of community
employment is uneven. While individual states show promise, national trends
continue to challenge the vision of greater employment opportunity. </li>

<li>Data from the Rehabilitation Services Administration (2002-2009)
suggest several trends. In 2009, the number of overall closures for people with
IDD within the VR system (67,837) and closures into employment (23,307)
declined to the lowest figures of the period investigated. Most closures for
individuals with IDD were people with an intellectual disability, but the
percentage of this group who are people with autism is growing. Of all the
closures in 2009, an increasing percentage involved transition-age individuals,
young adults between 16 and 26 years old at application, underscoring the
importance of supporting a pathway to employment and a career at a critical
life stage. Data also showed that the time span from application to closure
into integrated employment increased during the period studied, possibly
reflecting the impact of the recent recession. Weekly earnings and average
hours worked in integrated employment at closure decreased slightly, whereas hourly
earnings increased slightly. </li>

<li>Data from the American Community Survey highlight the continued trend
of people with disabilities as significantly less likely to work compared to
their non-disabled counterparts. Further, while the employment rate has
declined for many populations during the recent recession, the decline has been
more severe for subgroups of people with disabilities than for people without
disabilities. Among working-age Americans, people with any disability and
people with a cognitive disability were more likely to live in households below
the poverty line</li>

<li>Despite federal efforts to increase the use of work
incentives-such as PASS, IRWE, and BWE programs-SSA data
consistently show low numbers of enrollment in work-incentive programs across
states. SSI recipients with ID work more but participate in work-incentive
programs less frequently than their counterparts with other types of
disabilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Multiple datasets offer varying insights on the employment situations
of individuals with disabilities, and specifically intellectual and
developmental disabilities. While the data show limited progress in some
systems (e.g., a slight increase in hourly earnings for individuals who exit
the VR system), there remains an urgent need for a re-investment of attention,
priorities, and resources towards economic and employment opportunities for
individuals with IDD. </p>


<h2>A View from the Ground: <br>
Factors that Influence Individual Employment Choices </h2>

<p><b>Authors: Jaimie
Ciulla Timmons, Allison Cohen Hall, Jennifer Bose,<br>
Ashley Wolfe and Jean Winsor</b></p>

<p>As state IDD agencies continue to offer options from supported
employment to sheltered employment, a significant critique of the service
system is that it provides limited "choice." As researchers consider choice and
decision-making among individuals with IDD, their interaction with a host of
critical players throughout the employment process must be considered. Among
these critical players are family members, school-based staff, and
direct-support professionals who offer a range of support and perspectives over
the course of the employment journey. </p>

<p>While a variety of factors influence employment decisions, including
positive previous work experiences, supportive work environments, and social
integration with coworkers, individual relationships with key stakeholders are
central. What is less evident, however, is exactly how such critical players
influence employment-related decision-making for individuals with IDD, to what
extent those individuals' preferences correspond to existing employment
options, and how this influences their decision-making. This chapter details
findings of a qualitative study that examined such questions. Based on
findings, practical considerations for state IDD agencies are offered.</p>

<p>This topical chapter offers a qualitative, in-depth view of how
individuals with IDD make employment decisions, offering an opportunity to go "beyond
the numbers" presented in this book. This research presents interview data from
individuals with IDD, their family members, and their employment-support staff
as a way of providing ground-level context about individuals' employment
situations. </p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>

<p>Qualitative interviews were conducted with individuals with IDD, their
family members, and employment-support professionals from four Community
Rehabilitation Providers (CRPs) throughout Massachusetts.</p>

<h4>Recruiting participants </h4>

<p>The research team compiled a list of twelve CRPs in Massachusetts
based on nominations from field-based trainers, which included variation in CRP
sizes, regions, and cultures. From this list of twelve, the team selected four
CRPs to participate in the study, based upon organization size, geographic
location, and diversity in mission and philosophy. Each CRP contact was asked
to select four individuals working in a range of employment settings (explained
in more detail below). Staff from the CRP initially approached each individual
and inquired about his/her interest. Individuals were also asked to identify a
family member as well as an employment-support professional to be interviewed about
the individual's employment process. </p>

<h4>Data collection</h4>

<p>An in-person visit to each CRP occurred and included face-to-face
individual interviews that lasted approximately one hour each. A
semi-structured protocol guided each interview, but researchers encouraged a
free-flowing discussion. Each individual was asked about a) personal
background, b) circumstances or factors that influenced the search for their
current job, c) challenges and how they were overcome, and d) level of
satisfaction with their employment situation. Researchers then asked the
individual with IDD to identify one family member and one employment-support
provider who could give additional information about the individual's
employment process. These secondary participants were asked about a) their role
in identifying the employment preferences of the individual with IDD, b) the
individual's work history and employment options, c) their role in the
individual's decision-making process around employment, and d) their level of
satisfaction with the current employment situation. All interviews were
digitally recorded and sent to an independent transcription agency.</p>

<h4>Sample description</h4>

<p>The sample for this study consisted of 16 adults with IDD, seven of
whom worked in a sheltered-employment setting and nine of whom were
competitively employed. Researchers also conducted a total of 13 interviews
with family members and 15 interviews with employment-support staff. Please see
Table 12 for more details on participants.</p>

<p><em>* Several individuals identified the same
employment-support staff member to be interviewed. For this reason, 9 staff
members were interviewed about the employment processes of 15 individuals.</em></p>

<h3>Data analysis</h3>

<p>Interview data was analyzed using a qualitative
approach that included coding and memo-writing. A qualitative software program
(Atlas.ti for the PC) was used to conceptualize themes, store coded
transcripts, and sort data. Once all transcripts were coded, Atlas.ti was used
to generate "query reports." The data from the reports was used to write memos.
Memo-writing helped to organize themes from the data, which allowed the
research team to further develop, interpret, and analyze the data.</p>

<h3>Involving a co-researcher</h3>

<p>A methodological goal of this project was to fully involve an
individual with IDD as a co-researcher. The co-researcher participated in all
aspects of the research process, including guidance on the accessible consent
procedure, interviewing all individuals with IDD, independent coding of data,
and collaborative memo-writing. A project mentor supported all activities of
the co-researcher to ensure active engagement. </p>

<h2>Findings</h2>

<p>Findings showed a collection of people and factors considered
influential in employment-related decision-making for individuals with IDD.
These distinct groups of people and circumstances appeared consequential at
different points in time over the course of the employment journey. </p>

<h3>The Role of Family in the Formative Years</h3>

<p>Families were influential because they role-modeled employment and
instilled the belief that work was an expectation of adulthood. </p>

<p><em>Role-modeling</em>. Family members served as role models for employment throughout each
individual's childhood and adolescent years. Through role-modeling, family
instilled the belief that work was an expectation for adulthood. One
individual's family set the expectation that he was to become a hardworking
adult just like the other adults in his family. His mother and sister
role-modeled that employment can start during the adolescent years by
discussing their first employment experiences with him. </p>

<p>Family members were often the first to talk about
work as a means to achieve independence. Through role-modeling, family members
showed that employment is the typical means of earning income, and that work
allows for independence and personal satisfaction. One family member explained
this idea in more detail:</p>

<p><i>He knew I've always worked. He grew up knowing that
I was at work every day. Never missed work. Always had to do it. And I always
told him I have to work so I can support you. I have to work so you have a roof
over your head. I said, "You're going to have to do the same." And it's just
how I brought him up.</i></p>

<p>This individual shared similar thoughts of his
family member:</p>

<p><em>...my father always said to me that I could have a
good life if I try and get a job and I could have money to spend, like my own
money to spend.</em></p>

<p><em>Instilling the value and expectation of work.</em> Through years of
role-modeling, expectations about employment became deeply rooted and
ingrained. One family member said, "[Working] is what he sees around him, and
he thinks that's the normal way to grow up." Other families also provided
examples of how they instilled the value of work. A staff person explained that
one mother had long-established aspirations that her daughter would work, and
as a result the individual had strong employment goals. The parents and
siblings of another person in the study held high expectations that the
individual would be successful in employment, which paved the way for the
development of robust career goals. </p>

<h3>The Role of School-Based Staff and Early Employment Experiences</h3>

<p>Teachers and other high-school staff provided the first exposure to
work that often set the individual in a particular employment-related
direction. These early employment experiences shaped the way individuals
thought about employment, influencing preferences, career goals, and
self-confidence.</p>

<p><em>School-based staff provides first
exposure to work.</em>
Several of the staff interviewed mentioned teachers as being influential when
it came to initial work experiences. One individual's staff member explained
that his special-education teacher was likely important in the individual's
decision to go to work in the community, as he taught all of his students about
what it was like to work. In the case of another individual, teachers were
crucial in providing encouragement. While realistically reminding her that she
would need to work hard, the individual's high-school teachers also told her
she was capable of doing anything she wanted in life. This individual started
planning for employment in her last year of high school, talking with one of
her teachers about what it might be like to work in the community.</p>

<p><em>Shaping work preferences.</em> All of the individuals in the study had at least
one previous work experience (either paid, internship, or volunteer) that
shaped their employment preferences. The data showed that most previous jobs
were of a fairly limited range, including housecleaning, dishwashing, bagging
groceries, and retrieving shopping carts. This may be because initially the
focus was on helping individuals to obtain work experience, as opposed to
finding a job match. A staff person explained why he felt that these jobs were
sometimes necessary: "You just can't put anyone anywhere...We were just trying to
get him that first-time job."</p>

<p>These early experiences led individuals to refine their employment
interests and preferences. One individual who worked in a park in high school
continued searching for a job that was active, outdoors, and with a variety of
responsibilities. About the individual's early experiences, his father noted, "He
had some jobs and some responsibilities that he enjoyed. He did some lawn work
and grass mowing and maybe directed the visitors around the area. He was very
proud of his work there." </p>

<p><em>Shaping career goals.</em> Other individuals had early experiences that helped
them determine not only the type of job they wished to obtain, but also a
specific career they wished to pursue. One individual began his career planning
early when he expressed interest in working at his high school's bakery.
Through this work, he determined that he wanted to pursue culinary arts.
Another individual had early experiences caring for small children and decided
she would like to pursue a career in childcare. These career goals were shaped
while the individuals were still in high school and led them on specific
community career paths.</p>

<p><em>Shaping self-confidence.</em> Early
employment experiences also impacted individuals' confidence in their ability
to work in the community, and left some hesitant to pursue future jobs. For
several individuals, the difficulty occurred because they were placed in
positions where they could not complete the required responsibilities. The
impact of poor initial work experiences led some individuals later to choose
sheltered employment. However, other individuals were able to move past
negative experiences because they were strongly self-motivated, or supported by
family members or professionals to understand that the previous positions were
not failures but just poor job matches. </p>

<h3>The Role of the CRP's Culture when Offering Options</h3>

<p>The CRP's culture affects the way staff perceives and offers
employment options. The CRP's culture is comprised of its mix of services and
philosophy about job readiness. </p>

<p><em>Mix of services provided.</em> Three of the four CRPs in this study offered a mix
of employment settings, including sheltered workshops, enclaves and work crews,
and community employment. Only one of the CRPs exclusively offered community
employment. At the three CRPs that provided a mix of services, individuals
often revolved through, or simultaneously worked in community employment,
enclaves, and sheltered employment depending on the availability of community
jobs. This was a clear difference compared to the CRP that only offered
community employment, whose staff described its business as "...a vocational
program...we find employment and then we support them in their choice of careers."</p>

<p>The services provided by the CRP affect the way staff perceive and
offer options. For example, staff from one CRP that offers a mix of services
noted that they direct job-development resources only to individuals who want to
work in the community. While they encourage community employment for all
individuals they support, there is no expectation for someone to leave the
sheltered workshop. A staff member noted: "I see it as important to get more
and more jobs in the community and make the distinction of who is going to work
and who is not, and putting 100% of the job development resources into those
people."</p>

<p>In the CRPs with sheltered workshops, participants talked about the
workshop as a safety net that individuals can return to if they lose their
jobs. This can lead to gaps in employment history and affect the development of
good employment skills. In the CRP that only provides community employment,
individuals are encouraged to stay at a job that is not a perfect fit until a
new job can be found, because the alternative is unemployment. Staff supports
individuals to not simply quit their present job before finding another,
encouraging them to develop skills to responsibly transition between the two.</p>

<p><em>Philosophy about job readiness.</em> Three of the four CRPs (those that offered a mix of
employment services) believed that individuals needed to meet prerequisites to
be considered job-ready. Therefore, the existence of a "continuum of services"
facilitated assumptions about prerequisites needed for community employment. A
staff member from one of these CRPs noted that the sheltered workshop may be
the best employment placement for people who have challenging behaviors: "We
have clients who behaviorally, you know, they've been in a sheltered workshop,
and it's worked for them because they don't have the capability to be out in
the community." One family member commented that an individual had to be
determined by the CRP to be ready to "work outside" before seeking community
employment. In discussing one individual who wanted to work in the community,
the staff noted, "Up until recently, he really wasn't ready for working
competitively. He did the work crews. He did the internship, and this has all
kind of helped him become ready for a job."</p>

<p>These beliefs about employment readiness contrast greatly with those
at employment-only CRP. Staff from this CRP commented, "We look at all people
with disabilities [believing] that [they] can enter the workforce. Everyone
basically is job-ready." Another staff member at the same CRP noted, "Everyone
is pretty much job-ready as far as if you have a mind, body and spirit, you can
work. We feel that it's gainful employment for all, everyone." At this employment-only
CRP, the process of identifying career goals and opportunities begins quickly.
Their focus is to support the individual to participate directly and
immediately in the employment-planning process. </p>

<p>The three other CRPs provided opportunities for individuals to learn
tasks in a sheltered environment as preparation for community employment.
Work-preparation courses were offered that included training on computers, cash
registers, remedial reading and writing, customer-service, and stocking shelves.
Some of these skills were practiced in the CRP's cafeteria, restrooms, or
mailroom. Staff felt this curriculum was valuable because it would allow
individuals to obtain skills that would facilitate the transition to the
workforce. Individuals from these CRPs experienced a much slower path to
community employment versus those from the employment-only CRP.</p>

<p>Another CRP included internal short-term training opportunities and
internships in the community to increase job-readiness, addressing issues such
as distractibility and social skills. One individual who was participating in
these activities noted that this model led him to be "sitting around waiting
for work." However, staff felt that these activities prior to the job search
were necessary. One staff member said, "We have a lot of assessments that we do
on people...social and behavioral assessments. With this individual, you wouldn't
even need to do one to realize he wasn't ready." Overall, staff members
understood that some individuals wanted other jobs, but felt that a "progression"
to community employment was necessary.</p>

<h3>The Role of the Job Developer in Decision-Making</h3>

<p>The job developer emerged as the most influential person during the
job search, often directing decision-making about employment choices. Individuals
and family members often viewed their job developer as responsible for finding
employment, and thus were only minimally engaged.</p>

<p><em>Employment staff influences decision-making about job
choices.</em> Staff explained that when they presented a job
opportunity using positive language, the individual typically responded
positively and wanted to accept the offer. Additionally, when individuals were
apprehensive about employment, some staff noted that they had a very strong
influence on whether the individual would accept or reject a job offer. In
other cases, staff made an effort to serve as an advisor rather than a
decision-maker, helping the individual to weigh the pros and cons of a
potential job match. Too much influence on the part of the job developer was
found to inhibit self-determination and family involvement in the
decision-making process. </p>

<p>One individual who described making her own
decision about work said that it was the job developer who convinced her to
apply. This job developer noted the balance she tried to strike between
supporting the individual to make a good decision and allowing the person to
assert independence. The job developer said that often, individuals "are
looking for you to make the decision for them. I think that's a learned behavior.
So that when you give people more options or when you talk to people about what
they like to do-I think there's a certain amount of decision-making
that's a 50-50 type thing." </p>

<p>In certain instances, however, individuals felt they had either no
choice or limited choice in their job placement. One individual explicitly
reported that he had no choice in the decision to accept his job in the
workshop, while waiting for a job in the community. When asked why he chose the
job, the individual explained, "Because it's ...the only paying job they could
offer me right now until they could start looking for me for a real job. So
basically this job I'm working at now was put onto me for now until I get a new
job." </p>

<p><em>Limited engagement of the individual and family.</em> Individuals and family members often viewed their
job developer as responsible for finding employment and preparing the job
seeker to start work. Family members in particular perceived employment staff
as more knowledgeable and skilled than the family could be in helping the
individual find employment. While family members appear to be influential in
instilling the value of work, they are less engaged in the process of job
searching. </p>

<p>In some cases, family members were only minimally
engaged; although clearly interested in and supportive of the job search, they
were not aware of the details. In other cases, family members were not involved
in career planning at all. Several of these families expressed an interest in
being more involved, though they cited barriers including not wanting to be
viewed as a hovering parent, receiving limited communication from employment
staff, and feeling as though employment staff were the experts in career
planning. One parent noted: </p>

<blockquote><p>"We don't know anything about interviewing, and what
we would say is not the right way to say it. So sometimes input from an outside
source on certain issues like that, these people are trained. They know better;
you don't. They work much better."</p></blockquote>

<p>When asked about their involvement in the individual's decision to
accept a job offer, most family members said that they were minimally involved.
This parallels the finding that family impacts whether or not the individual
pursues employment, but are less involved in the specific aspects of the job
search and placement. </p>

<h3>The Role of Personal Preferences</h3>

<p>Individuals' personal reasons for work also influenced
employment-related decision-making. These were earnings, productivity, the
admiration of others, and the quality of social relationships. </p>

<p><em>Earning money</em>. Individuals in this study said
that their primary reason for working was to earn money to pay bills,
contribute to their households, pay for hobbies or interests, and save so that
in the future they could live independently. Of one individual, it was noted that
earning money would give him the independence to make his own decisions:</p>

<blockquote><p>"...He wants to be as independent as possible. He
wants to have an apartment. He wants to have a car. He wants to have all the
things that his brothers and sisters have and his family has. And he wants his
independence and wants to make decisions in his life."</p></blockquote>

<p>Several individuals also reported that the realization that one could
earn more money working in the community was a motivator for leaving the
workshop. Individuals reported being dissatisfied with the low wages of the
workshop. One individual noted that they were at the CRP from 9 a.m. to1:30
p.m. and only earned about $3 per day. Another individual preferred working on
a work crew to the workshop because the work crew offered better wages.</p>

<p><em>Productivity</em>. In general, individuals noted that they wanted to work so that they
could be productive members of the community. Along with the opportunity for
greater earnings, individuals in sheltered work were motivated to move into
community employment because of the increased productivity and the greater
variety of responsibilities it would entail. Many individuals reported
accepting a job because if they did not work they would feel bored, and would spend
their time sitting at home and watching TV. Individuals wanted to feel useful
and valued and to feel as if they have a reason to get up and a place to go. As
one individual noted, "I needed to keep busy. I like to keep busy. I used to
help [my mom] around the house and stuff like that, but I needed more of an
outlet in my life."</p>

<p>Individuals who felt productive at work reported that they were more
likely to remain at their jobs. Individuals cited having tasks they enjoyed,
always having enough work to do, being able to be physically active on the job,
being able to work at their own pace, and feeling confident in their job
responsibilities as reasons to remain employed. One individual said, "I felt
like a 'somebody' working in higher enterprise and going to work and then
coming back. I felt like a person, like someone normal would feel like in a job
and everything. And I'm helping the community, helping people with their
groceries. I felt good about that." </p>

<p>Individuals and their families in particular noted the desire for an
increase in work hours, another indicator of the preference for productivity.
CRP staff were aware of this concern, but noted that they felt uncomfortable
approaching employers about expanding work hours because such an increase could
require individuals to take on more complex responsibilities or earn special
certifications. </p>

<p><em>Admiration from others.</em> How friends, family members, and coworkers
perceived the quality of an individual's job performance impacted choices.
Having a high-quality, community-based job that was worthy of bragging about
resulted in a sense of pride. In fact, several individuals who transitioned
from the workshop to jobs in the community received praise for their
accomplishments from individuals and staff at their CRP, influencing others to
consider integrated jobs as well. </p>

<p>Being identified as a valuable part of a team by coworkers was another
factor that led individuals to either choose or to remain in community
employment. One individual shared praise he had received from the employer: "You're
a real good worker and you're helping all of us. We appreciate you, and we
really trust you to do everything." Another said that even though he worked a
busy Saturday at one retailer, he loved the job because he was a part of a team
"that gave 100 percent." </p>

<p><em>On-the-job social relationships.</em> Positive relationships with coworkers were critical
to choice-making. Friendships in the workshop between employees with
disabilities were found to provide a sense of camaraderie and social
connection. Friendships in the community between individuals and their
coworkers without disabilities were also found to provide these benefits. </p>

<p>Perceived social acceptance, especially from coworkers without
disabilities, appeared important. One individual's coworker made her mix CDs of
music that they both enjoyed listening to. Staff noted that another individual
not only chose to eat lunch with her coworkers instead of returning to the CRP
to eat, but that together they joined a craft committee. Another individual
said that he was satisfied with his job because his coworkers treated him with
respect. </p>

<p>Staff also acknowledged the importance of taking the time to identify
opportunities for social connectedness. They reported the importance of a
supportive job environment and a workplace culture where coworkers are
accepting, employers are flexible, and there is a willingness to provide
natural supports. For one person, a job that provides opportunities to be with
peers without disabilities can provide expansion of social networks. For
another, a good match might be a community job that helps to retain the friends
developed in the workshop, such as having the proximity to return for lunch.</p>

<p>When social connectedness was perceived in
community-based jobs, it was described as hard to find and requiring the right
fit. Although individuals in our study were described as well-liked, given a
lot of attention, and fully included in holiday parties and gift-giving, the
depth of the relationships appeared superficial or limited at times. One staff
member noted, </p>

<blockquote><p>"...He has some relationships at work. I think work is
a strong base for his sort of feeling of belonging and feeling of value. And he
has some people there that he has a relationship in that sort of way. I'm not
sure he has any strong, really social relationships at work of, 'Hey, the
weekend's coming up. You want to get together and go do something?' kind of
level." </p></blockquote>

<p>In certain cases, strong social connections made
in the sheltered workshop influenced choices about community employment.
Individuals who were considered to be "higher-functioning" in the sheltered
workshop often chose to stay there because it offered the individual the opportunity
to feel like an expert, achieve a certain status, and be revered among peers.
For example, a staff member noted that one individual feels a sense of
exclusion and difference when he is out in the community because of his
intellectual disability. However, when the individual is in the workshop, "He
may as well be staff. He helps everybody out; he helps people who are
lower-functioning. People look up to him. You know? And when he would go out
into the community, he had some issues with that, because his disability was
apparent." </p>

<p>Friendships with peers in the sheltered workshop
can become a barrier to choosing community employment. Staff noted that
individuals miss their friends in the workshop and that they work hard to
support individuals to believe that they can make friends in the community. Not
only can the fear of missing one's friends inhibit individuals from pursuing
work in the community, it can lead individuals to thwart their own success in
community-employment placements. </p>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<p>Findings showed a collection of people and factors considered
influential in employment-related decision-making for individuals with IDD.
Individuals benefited most from a consistent message about and expectation for
community employment across their key relationships. Furthermore, distinct
groups of people and diverse circumstances appeared consequential at different
points in time over the course of the employment journey.</p>

<ul>
<li>Families emerged dominant in the formative years, because they
role-modeled employment and instilled the belief that work was an expectation
of adulthood. </li>

<li>School-based staff provided the first exposure to work that shaped
preferences, career planning, and self-confidence. </li>

<li>The CRP's culture, comprised of its service mix and philosophy about
job readiness, affected the way staff perceived and offered employment options.
</li>

<li>The job developer became especially persuasive during the job search,
perceived by individuals and family members as responsible for job-finding, and
resulting in their decreased engagement. </li>

<li>Personal reasons for work, such as increased earnings, productivity,
the admiration of others, and the quality of social relationships swayed
individuals' decisions about staying in a current position and about whether to
pursue community or sheltered work. </li>
</ul>

<p>Based on these findings, the following recommendations are offered to
states as they provide effective employment options and services that support
individual choice. </p>

<h3>Engage Families: Start Early, and Support the Family to Stay Involved</h3>
<ul>
<li>Conduct early outreach to families that promotes the message that
competitive employment is an expectation for adulthood.</li>

<li>Engage families in educational forums to increase knowledge and
awareness of employment supports and benefits planning.</li>

<li>Sponsor employment fairs that facilitate connections between families
and state employment systems, benefits planning specialists, and local
businesses.</li>

<li>Think of family members as a resource. They are often experts in their
understanding of the individual's skills and support needs. </li>

<li>Deliberately engage families in employment-related problem-solving,
and create a mutual understanding of the relationship and roles.</li>

<li>Consider using a tool such as the 30-Day Placement Plan so that all
participants are informed and have assigned tasks that support the job search.
A tool such as this helps to ensure family involvement throughout the process. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Create Stronger and Earlier Links between Schools and Employment
Systems</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sponsor/participate in a local transition council for interagency
planning that includes all relevant stakeholders including community
rehabilitation providers, local IDD agency staff, vocational rehabilitation
counselors, school personnel, families, and individuals.</li>

<li>Host instructional presentations on such topics as adult service
programs, developing a transition IEP, customized employment, and
person-centered planning to improve teacher competencies around transition and
employment. </li>

<li>Train teachers to advocate for early community-based work experiences
for their students. </li>

<li>Educate school personnel about the range of community rehabilitation
providers and local services. Conduct CRP tours before graduation, or jointly
sponsor transition fairs to increase awareness of the service options, service
philosophies, and employment choices available. </li>

<li>Partner with school departments on curriculum development that
includes a strong employment component.</li>
</ul>

<div class="callout"><p>The 30-Day Placement Plan: A Road
Map to Employment is a tool developed by staff at the Institute for
Community Inclusion. This tool breaks down the job search into a series of
small tasks that make the process more manageable and keeps all participants
invested and engaged. It offers step-by-step instructions for writing a 30-day
plan and a series of case studies that exemplify the process. </p>

<p><i><a href="http://www.communityinclusion.org/article.php?article_id=151">www.communityinclusion.org/article.php?article_id=151</a></i></p>
</div>

<h3>Support the Ongoing Development of Provider Staff Competencies </h3>

<li>Host training for regional, area and provider staff on promising
job-creation and job-search strategies such as customized employment, job
carving and creation, resource ownership, and micro-enterprise.</li>

<li>Support comprehensive resource planning to identify individual support
needs in order to replace negative assumptions about an individual's "lack of
readiness" to work in the community. </li>

<li>Clearly tie the expected outcome of meaningful, competitive employment
to the responsibilities of local-level frontline staff.</li>

<li>Engage in cross-agency strategic planning to understand one another's
services and constraints, and to ensure that monetary and non-monetary
resources (space, transportation, expertise, etc.) are used to support
meaningful employment outcomes.</li>

<h3>Support Informed Choice</h3>
<ul>
<li>Consider core self-determination principles in policy development,
including the freedom to choose employment options, authority over resources,
and the ability to select support systems.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Create Opportunities to Build Social Connections Outside of the
Workshop</h3>
<ul>
<li>Facilitate collaboration with self-advocacy groups. </li>

<li>Encourage individuals to get involved in community activities with
others that share their interests, such as a knitting club or reading group.
Information for these groups can be found in the local library or community
center, or online. </li>

<li>Facilitate volunteering opportunities for individuals with
disabilities to give back to their community, gain skills, and develop
relationships. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Those working with people with IDD need to consider the people,
circumstances, and experiences that become consequential and persuasive at
different times over the course of their employment journeys. As the employment
agenda for this population pushes forward, targeted interventions at well-thought-out
decision-making points will maximize the chances for the most meaningful
employment options and outcomes for individuals with IDD in the years to come. </p>
